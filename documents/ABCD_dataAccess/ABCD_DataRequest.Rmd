## Research Interest

As an assistant professor at Auburn University, I am requesting an account to access shared data in the NIMH Data Archive so that I may be able to analyze ABCD data to study the relation between family characteristics and cognition. I am also enrolled as an observer in the upcoming ABCD-ReproNim Course (https://www.abcd-repronim.org) and plan to apply the tools and techniques covered in this course to analyze the dataset to answer my scientific questions.


## Data Use Certificate (DUC)

I am a researcher and assistant professor at Auburn  University, working in the Quantitative Methods in Educational Research learning community. Our research involves cognitive development and academic skills and we use existing data sets to explore relations within these skills. I am planning on integrating my expertise in these areas to ABCD initiatives to explore how environmental characteristics are related to cognitive and academic outcomes.
I will start conducting these analyses as part of the ABCD-ReproNim course (https://www.abcd-repronim.org). In addition to these analyses, I will use the ABCD data to generate new hypotheses prior to the courseâ€™s Project Week, to better understand the distribution of information, and to appropriately apply techniques and algorithms to this dataset. I will continue to use the data after the course to answer questions on the relation of cognition to motor skills, mental health, academic skills. We will also explore means of integrating these data with other large scale data set, such as Early Childhood Longitudinal Study as well as local data we collect.
